I'm a software developer, instructor, and tech nerd currently living in Belfast, Northern Ireland.

I'm the founder of [WeCode NI](https://wecodeni.com), a job board for developers in Northern Ireland, and I currently work at [Niice](https://niice.co). I also create instructional video courses for [egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/paul-mcbride?af=auhexg). I'm also the proud holder of a private pilot's license. üõ©Ô∏è

On this where I will share what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and my thoughts and feelings on software and life. I'll be treating this site as my "digital garden" ‚Äì that means as articles become old and out of date, they'll either be pruned or updated. All content on this site should be up-to-date and hopefully useful.

Want to learn more about me and my work? Check out my code on [Github](https://github.com/ThePaulMcBride), follow me on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@ThePaulMcBride), or get in touch by email at [hello@paulmcbride.com](mailto:hello@paulmcbride.com).

If you enjoy anything you read here or find it useful, I'd really appreciate you sharing it, or signing up to my newsletter where you can hear more about what I'm working on.
