I'm a software developer, instructor, and tech nerd originally from Belfast, Northern Ireland but now living in Pendleton, Oregon, USA.

I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com). I also create instructional video courses for [egghead](https://egghead.io/instructors/paul-mcbride?af=auhexg). I'm the proud holder of a private pilot's license. üõ©Ô∏è

On this site I will share what I'm working on, what I'm learning, and my thoughts and feelings on software and life. I'll be treating this site as my "digital garden" - that means as articles become old and out of date, they'll either be pruned or updated. All content on this site should be up-to-date and hopefully useful.

Want to learn more about me and my work? Check out my code on [Github](https://github.com/ThePaulMcBride), follow me on [Mastodon](https://indieweb.social/@ThePaulMcBride), or get in touch by email at [hello@paulmcbride.com](mailto:hello@paulmcbride.com).

If you enjoy anything you read here or find it useful, I'd really appreciate you sharing it, or signing up to my newsletter where you can hear more about what I'm working on.
