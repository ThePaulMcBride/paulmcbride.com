A new year, how exciting! Over the past few weeks, I've had some time off for Christmas. I've spend most of that time eating turkey, ham, and chocolate (not together).

I've also spent a lot of time reading! I got an Amazon Kindle recently and it has honestly changed my relationship with books. I went from reading around 1 or 2 books each year to around 3 per month now. I'm currently reading [Building a second brain](https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/book#pre-order-now) by Tiago Forte and A hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy by Douglas Adams.
